# prostatesegmentation
Classification and segmentation of prostate gland capsules

This projects presents a 2D image segmentation tool based on a UNet
encoder-decoder network, whilst also utilising the VGG16 classification model to
separate images with and without prostate glands.

Such a tool can aid in localising regions of interest during various urologic procedures, such as ablation therapy and needle biopsies.
